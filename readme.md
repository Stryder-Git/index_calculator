##CAUTION

The IndexCalculator class started as a solution to a specific personal use and ended up growing into something that 
I just wanted to create. It allows a lot of flexibility when calculating DatetimeIndexes and converting standard 
pricedata but, except for my own usage, a lot is still untested.
