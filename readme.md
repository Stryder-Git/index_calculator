##Description

This class aims to provide efficient calculations for generating a rich variety of possible datetime ranges.
The best way to familiarize yourself with the functionality and usage of this class is by having a look at 
the test `test_ways_of_using` in [ic_tests\test_IndexCalculator.py](https://github.com/Stryder-Git/index_calculator/blob/master/ic_tests/test_IndexCalculator.py).
You can also check out [ic_tests\test_IndexCalculator_alignments.py](https://github.com/Stryder-Git/index_calculator/blob/master/ic_tests/test_IndexCalculator_alignments.py)
to see many examples.

A brief demonstration:

#### CAUTION

This class allows a lot of flexibility but, a lot is still untested.

Particular caution when...
* using highly customized schedules
* using alignments with very low frequencies (4H - 1D)
* converting pricedata that you aren't certain to exactly match a schedule
