##CAUTION

I create the IndexCalculator class for a specific personal use and ended up building it into something that 
I just wanted to create. It allows a lot of flexibility when calculating DatetimeIndexes and converting standard 
pricedata but, except for my own usage, a lot is still untested.


# Description

This class aims to provide decently efficient calculations for generating a rich variety of possible datetime ranges.
The best way to familiarize yourself with the functionality and usage of this class is by having a look at 
the test `test_ways_of_using` in ic_tests\test_IndexCalculator.py. 

A brief demonstration:
